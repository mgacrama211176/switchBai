          "The deposit ensures games are returned in good condition. You pay the game value upfront (rental fee + deposit = game price). When you return the game undamaged, you get the full deposit back within 24 hours.

        question: "How does game delivery work?",
        answer:
          "We deliver to anywhere in Cebu City. You shoulder shipping costs both ways (sending the game to you and returning it to us). Delivery typically takes 1-2 business days. For rentals of 2 weeks or longer, meet-up is also available.",

      {
        question: "What payment methods do you accept?",
        answer:
          "We accept GCash, Bank Transfer, and Cash on Pickup. After you select your game and rental duration, we'll provide payment details and the exact amount (rental fee + deposit).",

        question: "Can I extend my rental period?",

        question: "What happens if I lose or damage the game?",
        answer:

        question: "Is there a minimum rental period?",

        question: "When will I get my deposit back?",
