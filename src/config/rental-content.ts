        question: "How does the deposit system work?",
        answer:
          "The deposit ensures games are returned in good condition. You pay the rental fee plus a deposit upfront (totaling the game's price). When you return the game undamaged, you get the full deposit back within 24 hours. For example: ‚Ç±1,200 game at ‚Ç±300/week = pay ‚Ç±1,200 upfront, get ‚Ç±900 back after return. Or ‚Ç±1,500 game at ‚Ç±350/week = pay ‚Ç±1,500 upfront, get ‚Ç±1,150 back.",

        question: "Can I swap games during my rental period?",

          "Yes! Game swaps cost ‚Ç±100. If you've rented for 2 weeks or longer and want to swap before your period ends, you'll get credits for unused days that can be applied to your next rental. Just contact us to arrange the swap.",

      {
        question: "What if I return the game late?",
        answer:
          "Late fees are ‚Ç±50 per day with no grace period. The fee is deducted from your deposit. To avoid late fees, return on time or contact us to extend your rental before the due date.",
      },
      {
        question: "How does game delivery work?",
        answer:
          "We deliver to anywhere in Cebu City. You shoulder shipping costs both ways (sending the game to you and returning it to us). Delivery typically takes 1-2 business days. For rentals of 2 weeks or longer, meet-up is also available.",
      },
      {
        question: "What payment methods do you accept?",
        answer:
          "We accept GCash, Bank Transfer, and Cash on Pickup. After you select your game and rental duration, we'll provide payment details and the exact amount (rental fee + deposit).",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I extend my rental period?",
        answer:

      },
      {
        question: "What happens if I lose or damage the game?",
        answer:
          "You're responsible for the game during rental. Normal wear is fine, but if a game is lost or severely damaged, the full game value is deducted from your deposit. Minor damage may result in partial deduction. Always report issues immediately upon receiving the game.",

      {
        question: "Is there a minimum rental period?",
        answer:
          "Yes, the minimum rental period is 1 week. You can rent for 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, or longer. The 2-week option is our most popular choice, offering the best value and flexibility.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I rent multiple games at once?",
        answer:
          "Yes! You can rent multiple games simultaneously. Each game requires its own rental fee and deposit. Contact us with your selections, and we'll calculate the total amount and coordinate delivery.",
      },
      {
        question: "When will I get my deposit back?",
        answer:
