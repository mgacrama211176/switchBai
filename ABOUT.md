# About SwitchBai üéÆ

## Our Story

**SwitchBai** started in 2023 in the vibrant gaming community of Cebu City,
Philippines. Born from a passion for gaming and a desire to make Nintendo Switch
games more accessible to Filipino gamers, we set out to create something
special.

The name "SwitchBai" combines our love for Nintendo Switch games with the
friendly Cebuano term "bai" (friend). It's our way of saying: we're not just a
store‚Äîwe're your gaming buddy, your trusted friend in the world of Nintendo
Switch games.

### Why We Started

As avid gamers ourselves, we noticed that many Filipino gamers wanted to
experience the best Nintendo Switch titles but found retail prices challenging.
We also saw incredible games sitting unused on shelves after players finished
them. That's when the idea clicked: what if we could create a community where
gamers could buy quality second-hand games, rent titles they're curious about,
and eventually trade games with each other?

## Our Mission & Vision

### Mission

**Making Nintendo Switch gaming accessible, affordable, and community-driven.**

We believe every gamer should have the opportunity to experience amazing
Nintendo Switch titles without breaking the bank. By offering verified
second-hand games at fair prices and flexible rental options, we're making that
possible.

We envision a future where SwitchBai is more than just a marketplace‚Äîit's a
thriving community where gamers connect, share experiences, and help each other
discover amazing games.
